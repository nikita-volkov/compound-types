-- Where there is a multiplication and addition,
-- there naturally must be a division and subtraction!

-- Following is an example of how we can extract parts of a composite type.
-- Here the type becomes the same as the following:

-- > Bool + Double
type BoolOrDouble =
  (SumAndProductMixture - Int - Char) / Char
